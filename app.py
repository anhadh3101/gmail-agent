Desktop application to run in background for fetching all emails.

1. Make desktop credentials on GCP and fix any configuration issues.
2. Get the APIs to develop the workflow for the app.
3. Develop the workflow to get the emails that were recieved in the last 24 hours or till some pivot point.
4. Figure out things we are going to configure on LangChain. (That is going to be the AI interface where emails are handled)
5. The flask app will help manage the information.

Need to build a frontend interface for getting the data.
